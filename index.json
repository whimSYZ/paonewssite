And also, it’s the first choice for most people to travel. However, the transfer between Line Batong and Line One always brings about a lot of unnecessary trouble, especially during the peak traffic time.\n In fact, the transfer rate between line Batong and Line One is almost 100 percent. All passengers will get off at Sihui East station and transfer to Line One. This directly leads to the congestion at the transfer station, thus wasting passenger’s time. JianXiang Xu, a senior at Communication University of China, agrees with it deeply.\n There are so many people transferring in the transfer station, so if you want to go to work on time, you have to go out very early and hurry up. Else you will be trapped in the transfer station.\n  Xu is now an intern at a company near the Olympic Sports Center. He needs to commute between the school and the company for an hour and a half every day, and he is required to arrive at the company before 9.30 a.m.. Therefore, the commute time is very tight for him. If he encounters traffic problems, he might be late.\n “It is really a waste of time to transfer between these two lines. I need at least three to five minutes on transferring.” He believes that the setting of the meaningless transfer station will do harm to his riding experience. It not only wastes his time but also affects his mood in the morning.\n Actually, HongYing Zhang, the Beijing Municipal People’s Congress, had already proposed to cancel the transfer in 2009; however, the subway company insisted that the conditions were not yet ripe. But in 2020, the merger of Line Batong and Line One has been officially put on the agenda, and construction will start soon.\n “There are two technical conditions for the connections of Line One and Line Batong. One is that the signal system needs to be connected, and the other is the integration of station equipments and facilities.” Metro Practitioner, Tian Wang, believes that the subway station nowadays already has mature technical conditions to connect these two lines, but it will still take a while to complete.\n “The connection of these two lines is definitely necessary, for it can save time.” Xu expressed his support, but he also raised his concerns. “ The congestion in these two lines have not been solved yet. Will there be more people on Line One after the connection? I don’t think that will be comfortable.”\n The connection of Line Batong and Line One is a necessity for people, and it is expected that the merger will be completed in 2020 or 2021. But there are still many issues for the railway sector to think about. The possible overcrowding of Line One after the connection and the impact of railway line changes in the social and economic life of the surrounding communities are issues that residents are very concerned about, but have not yet been answered.\n",

    "description": "Chinese college student:The connection between physical fitness test and scholarship overwhelms me",
    "body": "    var playerElement = document.getElementById(\"player-wrapper\"); var player = new Clappr.Player({ source: \"/Story 6/Video/Story 6 Video.mp4\", height: 360, width: 640, }); player.attachTo(playerElement);   Beijing, China\u0026ndash;In October 2020, all students from 2017 to 2020 of Communication University of China will receive the physical fitness test. The test consists of seven events: 800/1,000-meter-long run, standing long jump, pull-up/sit-up, sit and reach,50-meter sprint, height and weight (BMI), and vital capacity. The total score on the test is made up of the individual item scores weighted together. Among them, the 800/1,000-meter-long run and the 50-meter sprint account for the largest proportion of the total score.\n Throughout October, whether you come to the playground at night or day, you would see far more people than ever before. Almost all the students felt uneasy and anxious about the physical examination, because once can\u0026rsquo;t get 75 points above in the physical test, you will lose all the qualification of award evaluation. Qiu Tian, majoring in communication studies in the class of 2018, ranked the fourth in her class in her sophomore year. Her excellent academic performance gave her a great hope of winning the scholarship. The premise is that she must score at least 75 points in the physical test.\n To that end, Qiu started practicing on the playground three weeks ahead of schedule. During the physical test, she kept counting her scores, even accurate to a few tenths of a point. Except for BMI and sit-ups, where she got a perfect score, she tested again and again in every other event, including the 800-meter run, which most students didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go through a second time at all. However, she ended up with a score of 74.5.\n \u0026ldquo;I really tried my best. \u0026quot; She said. For students who are unable to take the test due to physical conditions or other reasons, according to the Student Handbook of Communication University of China, \u0026ldquo;Disabled students who are incapacitated can still participate in scholarships and outstanding student evaluations.\u0026rdquo; However, this kind of situation only applies to the disabled students who have lost the ability to exercise and can not recover. Temporary fever, allergy and even fracture can not be counted in this category, so they can only apply for exemption. This means that the results will be recorded as 60 points, which means that they will still lose the qualification of award evaluation.\n Teachers, on the other hand, believed that physical fitness is an effective measure of students\u0026rsquo; physical fitness and can motivate students to develop good exercise habits. As for the specific standards of every single event, Cai Haochen, a teacher in charge of the test, said, \u0026ldquo;It must be formulated by the higher authorities based on professional considerations, which is reasonable.”\n When mentioning that many students with excellent academic performance could not get scholarships due to physical examination, Jin Wei, the teacher in charge of students\u0026rsquo; comprehensive assessment, said she felt sorry for them, but still thought, “They could make it through hard work.”\n All in all, the original intention of the physical fitness test setting is to encourage students to develop a strong body while achieving excellent academic performance. However, when the physical fitness test and the qualification of award evaluation are linked together in such a strong and systematic way, it will inevitably lead to certain disputes and bring great pressure to a large number of students. There is still a long way to go to embed physical test into college life in a way that is recognized and accepted by students.\n",

This group aims at encouraging blind people to come outside and doing enough exercise to keep their physical health instead of staying in their home.\n In fact, although blind people’s rights have already been protected by laws and their life are also supported financially by welfare from government, their real lives are still monotonous and dull.\n “Blind people are less likely to go outside because we can not see and can not aware some dangerous conditions,” Li Xinchao said, who became blind at 17 years old.\n  “We always lack social activities and often stay at home, so we feel isolated and boring indoors,” said by Li.\n  Fortunately, there are groups like “He Yajun Blind People Helping Organization” that concentrate on blind people’s body and mental health.\n This organization builds a great volunteer group that consisted by people of different professions. The majority of those volunteers are sports enthusiasts, who also enjoy devoting their effort into public welfare.\n “I run every morning in Olympic park and I noticed this organization one day,” said by Luo Jiali, who is now the leader of the running team, “I think it is very meaningful to help blind people to come outside, so I applied for joining in this group immediately.”\n Guiding running is their principal daily work, additionally, marathons and emergency treatment courses are also included in their blind helping volunteer work.\n At 6 a.m. every Wednesday and Saturday, volunteers and their blind friends gather at the south gate of Beijing Olympic Forest Park. After doing some warming up activities, the five-kilometer long distance run begins.\n Blind people are served one on one by volunteers, their hands are linked by a string, which tells blind people directions of roads. Through the whole running process, volunteers take good care of blind runners and water and sports beverages are provided for them to maintain their physical strength. After running, stretching exercise is arranged by workers for blind people to relax their muscle.\n Both of blind people and volunteers benefit a lot from this process.\n Li said, “Running do improve my physical and mental health, I get cold less after running every week.”\n He also mentioned that, “Besides running, volunteers also take us to homes for aged to do volunteer works like blind massages. These activities made me more responsible and confident because we can even repay the society instead of merely receiving help.”\n Volunteers gain love and happiness. “We become good friends ,even like a big family,” said by Luo, “We make dumplings together and share our food during holidays, that is the most joyful moment I have.”\n",

Located on the Beijing Third Ring Road, Panjiayuan Flea Market has lost much foot traffic due to the epidemic, forcing many vendors to withdraw from the market and find other ways to earn a living. However, the crisis Panjiayuan Flea Market faces is not just the epidemic, but also the fierce competition brought about by the electronic economy.\n In the 21st century, the concept of the electronic economy has penetrated into people’s daily life. The transactions of second-hand goods are gradually taking online platforms. Therefore, as a long-established offline flea market, Panjiayuan also faces challenges. The convenience and efficiency of electronic transactions enable consumers to find and get what they want without leaving their home. Jiang Xiaolu, a vendor who has set up a stall in Panjiayuan for 6 years, is deeply worried about the emergence of electronic transactions. He is convinced that the electronic economy has caused Panjiayuan to lose many consumers, and the epidemic has aggravated operating difficulties. Many vendors have dismantled their stalls to avoid further loss. To cope with the current situation, he has considered purchasing cameras and other equipment to promote and sell his products online, transferring his transaction method from offline to online.\n However, Zou Jielong, who has been running his business in Panjiayuan Flea Market for 27 years, is full of hope for the future of Panjiayuan. He believes that Panjiayuan Flea Market has the potential to become a well-known tourist attraction in China and even in the world. He has a wide range of consumers, including foreigners from South Korea and Japan. Additionally, in the past two years, he has received countless orders of his Chinese calligraphy brush pens from Beijing’s primary and middle schools in response to China’s call for “bringing traditional culture into campus”. As for Zou, Panjiayuan Flea Market is not only a market for second-hand transactions; it also carries the characteristic culture of China. It has become a landmark in Beijing and has given birth to a new direction for cultural development.\n",

Promoting the spirit of frugality, the “Clear the Plate Campaign” hopes to alert and respond to the increasingly severe grain issue in China, also around the world.\n The “Clear the Plate Campaign” has been carried out vigorously after the speech themed frugality delivered by President Xi Jinping. And on Weibo, the topics relevant to the campaign has been read by more than a billion times.\n To promote the campaign, the catering industry has introduced ways to reduce food waste like displaying conspicuous slogans, encouraging post-meal packing and offering discounts if customers cleared their plates. Meizhoudongpo Restaurant, a large chain restaurant in China, introduces a policy nationwide that customers can choose to order foods in small sized servings. And those who finish all their meals will be rewarded with coupons. “Customers will be suggested with appropriate quantity of food,” said Zhang Yanmei, the manager of Meizhoudongpo, “we also provide free packing box if customers have leftovers.”\n College canteens also take active participation in this campaign. Jiangxi University of Technology introduced a policy that students can exchange fruits with their empty plates. In Nanchang Hangkong University, students can collect stamps when clearing their plates and exchange the stamps for a set of postcards. In other colleges, there are volunteers serving in canteens accompanied with slogans and banners displayed on campus.\n With the COVID-19 pandemic underlining the fragility of food systems, and worsening food loss and waste in many countries, António Guterres, Secretary General of the UN called for “new approaches and solutions” to solve the challenges in 2020.\n In China, the total amount of food wasted every year is equivalent to about 50 billion kilograms of grain, accounting for one tenth of the country’s total grain output. As much as 200 billion yuan worth of food is wasted on the table every year.\n  Professor Lin Yuan from the School of Marxism Studies of Communication University of China was interviewed and according to her, frugal culture not only exists in China, but also in the culture of most countries and regions all over the world, having different forms though.\n At the same time, Lin pointed out that attention should be paid to balance the effectiveness, legality and rationality of the measures adopted in the “Clear the Plate Campaign.” She suggested that soft incentives should be given priority and measures that blindly pursuit notable results and harm the rights and interests of consumers should be avoided.\n It is also important to note, Lin argues, that the campaign should not be explained in such a narrow and rigid way that not a single grain of rice is allowed to be left behind. Actually, the real purpose of the “Clear the Plate Campaign” is to encourage people to experience the culture of frugality and to incorporate that spirit into their future lives.\n",

However, as time passes by, the department store seems to fail in keeping up with the trends and become less competitive. As a consequence, Wangfujing Group Co., Ltd, the management of the department store, decides to upgrade it from a traditional, old-fashioned store to an international fashion selected shop, which intends to match the style of Wangfujing Street and attract more potential young customers.\n According to Fan Wenyu, the manager of the marketing department of Dong’an Department Store, the store used to be the most fashionable place for youngsters in Beijing. Through the new orientation of youth and the future, they hope to revitalize the store and win young customers back. Therefore, after the transformation and upgrading, most of the brands in the store will be street fashion brands that sell clothes and accessories such as Off-White and EVISU. “The change will be beyond people’s imagination,” Fan described.\n Fan explained that the idea was inspired by more and more time-honored brands trying to build new images. “We just take advantage of the trend that more and more domestic brands are launching products that cater for young people, trying to make themselves more dynamic,” Fan said. “I don’t think being young and fashionable conflicts with the profound history of time-honored brands. We’re in the hope of bringing the old brand more vitality, and it is more in line with the needs and development of the times.”\n However, Yu Han, the associate professor of the School of Economics and Management in Communication University of China, holds a different opinion. She talked about the socio-economic reality and the aggravating trend of the aging population in China. “China is facing the problem of the aging population, the proportion of old people is increasing surprisingly,” she mentioned. Yu also pointed out that the elderly may have difficulties in adapting to new technology and using electronic devices, which means they can’t do online shopping as easily and conveniently as others. Besides, compared to young people, older citizens usually have more spare time to go to department stores and select what they want.\n \u0026ldquo;I think the department store should figure out what its customers really need when they plan an upgrading,” said Yu. “The market for the elderly is quite potential as well. You don’t have to attract customers of all ages. Actually, it may be a better and wiser choice for the store to keep the old people as its target customers.\u0026rdquo;\n ",
